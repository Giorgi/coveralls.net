Coveralls uploader for .Net Code coverage of your C# source code. Should work with any code files that get reported with the supported coverage tools, but the primary focus is CSharp.

Install
-------

### The new way ####

The new way is using the dotnet SDK tools. This can be installed from version 2.0.0.

``` powershell
# install globally
dotnet tool install --global coveralls.net --version 2.0.0

# install into a local folder
dotnet tool install coveralls.net --version 2.0.0 --tool-path tools
```

To run the new version, simply use the command:

``` powershell
# if installed globally, this should just be available on your path
csmacnz.Coveralls <args>

# if installed into a tools path, you can run it from there.
.\tools\csmacnz.Coveralls <args>
```

Haven't got the latest tools? You can still use the new version thanks to the published zip stand-alone app versions. These can be found in GitHub Releases for each platform, `window`, `linux` and `osx`.

For example on windows, you can download and unzip the windows stand-alone version:

``` powershell
# The TLS change was necessary on my development machine
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12

$zipDownloadPath="https://github.com/csMACnz/coveralls.net/releases/download/2.0.0/coveralls.net.2.0.0-windows.zip"
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing $zipDownloadPath -OutFile coveralls-windows.zip
mkdir coveralls-windows
Expand-Archive .\coveralls-windows.zip coveralls-windows

.\coveralls-windows\csmacnz.Coveralls.exe

```
#### pre dotnet 3.1 ####

If you are not yet on 3.1 you can still use Version 1.0.0 which runs on dotnet 2.1 runtimes and above (using envvar `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD` set to `Major` for 3.0), following essentially the same instructions as above.

#### The older old way ####

Version 0.7.0 is still available on nuget at [www.nuget.org/packages/coveralls.net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/coveralls.net). This is a full .Net Framework exe that even runs on mono.

To install coveralls.net you can find it by searching for `coveralls.net` in the visual studio nuget extension, or install by running this command in the Package Manager Console.

``` powershell
PM> Install-Package coveralls.net -Version 0.7.0
```

You can get help for this older version using:

``` powershell

# on windows
csmacnz.Coveralls.exe --help

#on mono
mono csmacnz.Coveralls.exe --help
```

For more information, checkout the old version readme: https://github.com/csMACnz/coveralls.net/blob/release-0.7.0/README.md
